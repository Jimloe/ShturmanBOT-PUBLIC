# ShturmanBOT

Currently in a massive rework to add structure to the bot and to provide better readability and scaleability. ShturmanBOT-OLD.py is the original creation, just for archival purposes.

ShturmanBOT is being designed as a Discord/Subreddit moderator tool to assist /r/EscapeFromTarkov with catching posts that violate the rules,
and to enforce flairs on the subreddit.  It also functions as a dev tracker that'll post notifications in a set Discord channel.
